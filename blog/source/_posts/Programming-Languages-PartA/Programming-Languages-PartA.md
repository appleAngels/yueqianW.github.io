I'm start learning the CS Course (Programming Languages PartA)

## Course Organized

> This course is about an opportunity to learn the fundamental concepts of programming languages and we're going to do it in a way that will I believe, make you a better programmer in any programming language.

<!-- more -->

![introduction](/../images/Programming-Languages-PartA/welcome1.png)

### The course will use:

-   ML
-   Racket
-   Ruby

### Course's point is:

> The idea is really to learn the ideas around which every programming language is built and understand precisely the different ideas that we use when we program, and how those ideas are expressed in lots of different programming languages.

> It's really about getting past the surface level distinctions between languages and getting at the core ideas.

### Front knowledge

-   mechanics and structure
-   six more introductory videos

### Text Editor

-   Emacs or Vscode, build for ML program

### Homework 0 (optional)

> Change one character in one file and then go through the process of uploading your solution for the auto-grader, and participating in peer assessment.
>
> Understand the mechanics of uploading the homeworks for this course.

### Second resource (note in class)

-   write down teacher's ~~thorough~~ precise explanation.

### Lecture Code

-   available

### Peer assessment

-   to look at certain stylish use in the code.
-   learn from looking at each other's solutions.

### Exams

-   write code
-   cover topics better in a format other than written homeworks.

### Homework

-   basically one per major course section.
-   synthesize a lot of the topics and have it all fit together.
-   turn it in and see how you did

### Disadvantage

-   can't get a lot of feedback
-   the homeworks kind of come in big chunks

### Video and homework

-   totally connected
-   figure out what we're asking about, then work on writing the code, then test it out

### How To Learn

-   take a solution you think is correct, make it wrong and check that it's wrong in the way you expect.
-   Play around with variations, try different things.

### challenge problems (optional)

-   a great opportunity to go a little further.

### discussion forums

-   ask if something is confusing
